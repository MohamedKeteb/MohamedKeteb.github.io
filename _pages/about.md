 I am a Phd student at [The Department of Information Systems, Data Analytics and Operations](https://ido-department.essec.edu/)  at [ESSEC Business School](https://www.essec.edu/fr/) under the supervision of Professor [Pierre E. Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/).

I am interested in sampling, Monte Carlo methods (MCMC and unbiased MCMC), and Markov chain theory (spectral gaps, couplings, and ergodicity). At the moment, I am working on coupling techniques for MCMC algorithms and on the estimation of normalization constants.
