 I am a Phd student at [The Department of Information Systems, Data Analytics and Operations](https://ido-department.essec.edu/)  at ESSEC Business School under the supervision of Professor [Pierre E. Jacob](https://sites.google.com/site/pierrejacob/).

 I am interested in sampling and Monte Carlo methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo, Unbiased MCMC, couplings of MCMC algorithms) both from a methodological and a theoretical point of view.
